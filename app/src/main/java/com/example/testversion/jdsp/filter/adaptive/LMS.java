/**
 * <h1>Least-mean-squares (LMS) adaptive filter</h1>
 * The LMS adaptive filter is a filter that adapts its filter weights to get an input signal x to match a desired output
 * signal (= the output of the filter). It does this by trying to minimize the squared error between the desired signal
 * and the filter output signal.
 * Additionally, you can use a Leaky LMS filter by setting the leakage factor in the LMS constructor.
 * A leakage factor of less than 1 results in improved stability and tracking of the filter.
