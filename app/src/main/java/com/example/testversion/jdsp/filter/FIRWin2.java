/**
 * <h1>Finite Impulse Response Windowed Filter 1 Class</h1>
 * The FIRWin2 Filter class is used to compute the coefficients of the linear phase FIR filter given the cutoff frequencies,
 * their corresponding gains and the number of filter coefficients.
 * This class extends to the abstract class _FIRFilter which also allows for computing the filter output for an input signal.
 * This class can create 4 types of filters:
 * - Type 1 filters
 * - Type 2 filters (which have zero response at the Nyquist frequency)
 * - Type 3 filters (which have zero response at the zero and Nyquist frequencies)
 * - Type 4 filters (which have zero response at the zero frequency)
 *
 * The possible combinations to achieve each of these filters is:
 * - Type 1: 'numTaps' is odd and 'antisymmetric' is false
 * - Type 2: 'numTaps' is even and 'antisymmetric' is false
 * - Type 3: 'numTaps' is odd and 'antisymmetric' is true
 * - Type 4: 'numTaps' is even and 'antisymmetric' is true
