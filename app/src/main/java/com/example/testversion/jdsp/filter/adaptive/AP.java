/**
 * <h1>Affine Projection (AP) adaptive filter</h1>
 * The AP adaptive filter uses affine projection algorithm to improve the performance of LMS-based adaptive filters.
 * This filter is useful when the input data is highly correlated.
 * AP uses multiple input vectors for each sample where the number of input vectors depends on the projection order.
