/**
 * <h1>Complex Deconvolution</h1>
 * The ComplexDeconvolution class implements methods to recover signals which are convolved with a kernel. This function only
 * works if the output of the convolution is a complex signal and if the original signal has been convolved in 'same' mode
 * or 'full' mode. Given the convolved signal, the convolutional kernel used and the mode of convolution; the process
 * can recover the original signal.
 * The recovered signals can be complex or real.
 * For 'full' mode, FFT-based deconvolution is used.
 * For 'same' mode, the overlap-and-add based deconvolution is used.
 * NOTE: Outputs may vary from the *scipy.signal.deconvolve* implementation which uses inverse filtering.
