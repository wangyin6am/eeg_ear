 * <h1>Generalized Normalized Gradient Descent (GNGD) adaptive filter</h1>
 * The GNGD adaptive filter is an extension of the normalised least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filter. It adds an
 * additional gradient adaptive term in the denominator of the learning rate term, which allows it to adapt its learning
 * rate according to the dynamics of the input signal.
